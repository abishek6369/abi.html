 <i>   My Happy Marriage was among 2023's stand-outromance anime, but season 1 had room 
    
    for improvement.While still too early to definitively say, the sequel 

    is shaping up to be a minor step up, largely thanks tothe introduction of 
    
    antagonists who (so far) seem lessone-note than Miyo's abusive family.Season 2
    
    shines a brighter light on this world's more fantastical elements, with 
    
    both Kiyoka and Miyo havingto use their gifts during encounters with members
     
    of an organization that seems to have noble intentions onthe surface. Although
   
    shrouded in mystery, the GiftedCommunion proclaims to be interested in true
    
    equality by bestowing gifts to everyone, not just the elite families.

<h3>6.Blue exorcist

<i>
      Blue Exorcist seems like it should be a bigger deal, but the adaptation took a bit
       
    too long to produce sequels. Unfortunately, the hype has been relatively

    muted since the show's 2024 return, despite the seasonsthemselves being good.
    
    Packed with reveals and led by two lovable characters, the Winter 2025 arc is well

    on its way to being the best entry yet; however, it is solely for fans who have
    
    been watching from the start. Newcomers will be completely lost if they try

    to start with The Blue Night Saga, dulling its impact in the process.Rin goes on 
    
    a trip through time, getting a first-hand view of his mother's relationship with
    
    both Shirou and Satan. After only being shown in bursts, Yuri is pushedto the forefront
    
    during this season, and she is charming,charismatic, and just all-around endearing.
     
    Her dynamic with Shirou is endearing, while she serves as a positiveinfluence on Satan
     
    at first. As Mephisto constantly brings up, this story will end in tragedy. </i>

<h3>5.The Hundred Girlfriends Who Really Love You</h3>
<h4 style="color: gray;">(The Ultimate Harem Comedy Anime)

<i>
    Harem anime are an acquired taste, and they do not tend to get mainstream attention. While
     
    still niche,The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really,Really Love You is
     
    more accessible than most of the genre's offerings due to primarily being a comedy, albeit 
    
    one that is entirely driven by harem silliness and tropes. The first season established
    
    the anime's style of parody humor, all the while showcasing Rentarou's brilliance as a 
    
    worthy MC and the girls' uniqueness beyond just a defining personality trait.Season 2 ramps
    
    up the absurdity as more and more soulmates are added to the mix, continuing the story's
    
    relentless march toward actualizing its title's promise. While not completely devoid of 
    
    quieter moments, 100 Girlfriends has completely embraced its over-the-top parody nature,
    
    throwing out any semblance of logic in pursuit of louder and longer laughs.For example,
    
    a segment involved the girls trading bodies,while another reverted most of them to children
    
    . Season 2 also delivered one of the most powerful karaoke sessions ever.

<h3>4.Sakamoto Days</h3>
<h4 style="color: gray;">(A Decent Start With Some Rough Edges)

<hr>
<pre>
<br> 
<i>
      Putting aside sequels, Sakamoto Days was the most hyped anime

     of Winter 2025, solely thanks to the quality of Yuto Suzuki's

    source material. However, the adaptation's promotional material

    undermined its original momentum, garnering criticism for 

    lackluster animation that seemed to fail to replicate the manga's 

    kinetic energy.
    
        
        Sakamoto Days is an action-comedy about a legendary hitman who decides

    to settle down after falling in love. Nowadays, he runs a convenience 

    store and spends his days with his loving wife and adorable child.

    Unfortunately, retirement is not an option, and Sakamoto will have 

    to protect his new life from his old one. Also, he hires a gunman who

    was originally sent to kill him.
    
    The anime has been fine so far, nothing more and nothing less. The manga's

    sharp wit and lovable characters have mostly served the transition in one 

    piece, and Sakamoto Days is at its best when the focus is on the banter rather

    than the action. However, the latter is also a big part of this story, and it 

    has been inconsistent in the adaptation so far. Just to be clear, the fight

    sequences are not unwatchable nor devoid of tight choreography, but they 

    lack the source material's punch or style.

<h3>3.Dr.Stone</h3>
<h4 style="color: gray;">(Hopefully, An Epic Expedition)

</h4>

<pre>
<br> 
<i>

     In its fourth season, Dr. Stone is a known quantity by this point. Consequently,

    the enthusiasm surrounding the series has become somewhat muted,especially since

    it is unlikely to attract new viewers this late in its run. Still,Dr. Stone is

    reliably entertaining, offering a well-done shonen blend that combinescomedy,

    drama, and adventure.

     Science Future finds the Kingdom of Science heading to the United States,starting

    things off with a perilous and lengthy trip across the ocean. The first two episodes

    are dedicated solely to this journey, essentially serving as a precursor to this saga's

    main arcs. While perfectly enjoyable, Science Future leaned heavily on humor during

    these episodes, including starting things off with an episode revolvingalmost entirely.
    
    However, things pick up considerably once the Kingdom of Science arrivesin the United

    States, and they do not receive a warm welcome. While every arc tries tointroduce a c

    haracter who can challenge Senku's intellect, Science Future has specificallyxcelled 

    in this area. Xeno Houston Wingfield is simultaneously Senku's mentor and evilcounterpart

    , and their pre-world freeze connection is a fun twist.

<h3>2.The Apothecary Dairies Season 2</h3>

<hr>
<pre>
<br> 
<i>
    Setting the bar extremely high with its first season, The Apothecary Diaries is back for

    another 24 episodes, and there is nothing to suggest the sequel will fail to live up to 

    its predecessor's high standards. While still early days, the Winter 2025 anime has not 

    missed a beat so far, carefully and seamlessly blending humor, drama, historical inspirations,

     and world-building.
    
    With her sly wit, effortless charm, and resilience to romance checkpoints, Maomao is the main 

    reason to watch The Apothecary Diaries. Obsessed with investigating medicine and poison, Maomao's

    peculiar talents prove to be surprisingly useful for investigating strange cases that transpire 

    within the Imperial Palace's grounds.
    
    Season 2 got things going with a pretty lighthearted episode that mostly revolved around a cat.

    However, this seemingly silly plot thread was used to showcase different sides of a couple of key 

    characters, all the while sprinkling in a few historical factoids. The Apothecary Diaries has been 

    constantly brilliant at using "episodic" stories to peel back not only the characters' layers but also


    the larger society they live in. The subsequent episodes introduced a compelling mystery that had a

    clever solution, while also presenting plenty of opportunities for humor.

<h3>1.Solo Leveling Season 2</h3>
<h4 style="color: gray;">(The Biggest Winter 2025 Anime)

</h4>
<a href="https://youtu.be/byJ7pxxhaDY?si=v0PeAJ7fo42SkTXx"><img src="siva.png" alt="Solo levelling" height="200px"> </a>

<button style="background-color: white;color:black;position: center;size: 15px;">TV-MA</button> 

<button style="background-color: white;color:black;position: center;size: 15px;">Action</button> 

<button style="background-color: white;color:black;position: center;size:15px;">Fantasy</button>

<hr>
<pre>
<br> 
<i>
    Arguably the most well-known manhwa of all time, Solo Leveling was destined to receive

    an anime sooner or later, but quality was far from guaranteed. Fortunately, the responsibility

    fell on A-1 Pictures, and the dependable studio went on to produce a polished first season in 

    2024. While the story was nothing too special, the action sequences were fantastic, delivering

    smooth and fast-paced animation that veered into cinematic territory.

    Even though it still has a ways to go before concluding, season 2 has arguably already surpassed 

    its predecessor, and by quite a margin. At this point, Sung Jin-woo is well on his way to completing

    his evolution into the strongest hunter in existence, a journey driven by his ability and desire to

    build an overwhelming army of shadows.
    
    While not lacking in interesting lore drops or revelations, Solo Leveling Season 2: Arise from the

    Shadow has wisely opted to prioritize its main selling point: Action. Nearly every weekly release

    features a fantastic fight sequence, with episode 6 reaching a high point that very few other anime

    can hope to match. If somebody is not into action or hates OP protagonists, they will not get much

    out of Solo Leveling; however, in terms of what it is trying to be, this anime is the peak. Episode 

    9 even contained a surprisingly effective emotional moment, something Solo Leveling has arguably

    lacked since its early days.
